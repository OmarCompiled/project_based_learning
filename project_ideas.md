20 Mini Coding Projects for Beginners/Intermediates

1. Temperature Converter
   - Background: Create a program that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin. The user should be able to choose the unit of input and the target unit for conversion.
   - Prompt: If the user inputs "Fahrenheit to Celsius," convert using the formula C = (F - 32) * 5/9. Allow the reverse as well, along with Kelvin.

2. FizzBuzz
   - Background: A classic programming challenge used in interviews.
   - Prompt: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of 5, print "Buzz." For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."

3. Simple Calculator
   - Background: Build a basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
   - Prompt: Ask the user to input two numbers and the operation (+, -, *, /). The program should output the result. Handle potential errors like division by zero.

4. Palindrome Checker
   - Background: Palindromes are words that read the same forwards and backward, like "racecar."
   - Prompt: Create a program that checks if a given word is a palindrome. Ignore spaces and case.

5. Age in Days Calculator
   - Background: This program will calculate a user's age in days based on their birthdate.
   - Prompt: Ask the user for their birthdate and use the current date to compute their age in days. Handle leap years if possible.

6. Tip Calculator
   - Background: Help users calculate tips for a meal.
   - Prompt: Ask for the total bill amount, the percentage they want to tip (e.g., 10%, 15%, 20%), and the number of people to split the bill with. Return the total per person.

7. Number Guessing Game
   - Background: A simple game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number.
   - Prompt: Have the program randomly pick a number between 1 and 100. Let the user guess until they get it right, with hints like "too high" or "too low."

8. Vowel Counter
   - Background: Count how many vowels are in a given sentence.
   - Prompt: Ask the user for a string of text, then count how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) it contains, ignoring case.

9. Simple To-Do List
   - Background: Build a program that helps users manage simple tasks.
   - Prompt: Allow the user to add, remove, and view tasks in a list. Each task should have a unique ID.

10. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
   - Background: A simple game where the user plays against the computer.
   - Prompt: The user selects rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly chooses. Print the result of the match.

11. Word Counter
   - Background: Count the number of words in a given sentence.
   - Prompt: Ask the user for input text and count the total words by splitting the string based on spaces.

12. Movie Ticket Price Calculator
   - Background: Calculate the cost of movie tickets based on age.
   - Prompt: Kids under 12 pay $10, adults 13-64 pay $15, and seniors 65+ pay $12. Ask for the number of each type of ticket and calculate the total.

13. Dice Roller
   - Background: Simulate rolling dice and calculate results.
   - Prompt: Let the user input the number of dice they want to roll and how many sides the dice should have (e.g., 6-sided, 12-sided). Then, roll them and display the results.

14. Simple Password Generator
   - Background: Randomly generate a secure password.
   - Prompt: Ask the user for the desired length and whether they want special characters. Generate a password based on their choices.

15. Unit Converter
   - Background: Convert common units such as distance (miles to kilometers), weight (pounds to kilograms), and volume (liters to gallons).
   - Prompt: Allow the user to choose which units they want to convert between and input the value.

16. Prime Number Checker
   - Background: Check if a given number is prime.
   - Prompt: Ask the user to input a number and check if itâ€™s prime by dividing it by all numbers up to its square root.

17. Factorial Finder
   - Background: Calculate the factorial of a number (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120).
   - Prompt: Ask the user for a number and calculate its factorial using either recursion or a loop.

18. Caesar Cipher
   - Background: A simple encryption method where each letter in a text is shifted by a certain number of positions.
   - Prompt: Ask for a string and a shift value, then encrypt the text by shifting each letter forward by the shift amount.

19. BMI Calculator
   - Background: Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight and height.
   - Prompt: Ask the user for their weight in kilograms and height in meters. Use the formula BMI = weight / (height^2) to calculate and display their BMI category (underweight, normal, overweight, or obese).

20. Reverse a String
   - Background: Reverse the characters in a string.
   - Prompt: Ask the user for a string, and reverse the order of the characters in it without using built-in functions.
